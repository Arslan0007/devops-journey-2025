# 🚀 DevOps & AI Journey 2025

**From Embedded Systems to Intelligent Agents.**
This repository documents my engineering journey as I transition from a background in UAV R&D and Technical Project Management to **AI Engineering and DevOps**.

Here, I build and deploy real-world applications to master the modern software lifecycle—focusing on Python, Containerization, and AI integration.

## 📂 Featured Project: The Gist
**Status:** *In Development*

In an age of information overload, **The Gist** is a "digital declutter" assistant designed to cut through the noise. It processes large blocks of text and returns exactly what you need to know.

### Core Features
* **The Bottom Line:** A one-sentence summary of the input text.
* **Action Items:** Automatically extracts tasks and "to-dos."
* **Urgency Score:** Analyzes the tone to determine priority.

### Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Logic:** NLP / Text Processing (Planned integration with LLMs)

## 🗺️ The Roadmap
I am building this repository "in public" to demonstrate competency in the following areas:

- [x] **Python Application Development** (Building "The Gist")
- [ ] **Containerization:** Dockerizing the application for consistent environments.
- [ ] **CI/CD:** Setting up pipelines (GitHub Actions) for automated testing.
- [ ] **Cloud Deployment:** Hosting the application on a cloud provider (AWS/GCP).
- [ ] **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Managing resources with Terraform/Ansible.
