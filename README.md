# 🚀 DevOps & AI Journey 2025

**From Embedded Systems to Intelligent Agents.**
This repository documents my engineering journey as I transition from a background in UAV R&D and Technical Project Management to **AI Engineering and DevOps**.

Here, I build and deploy real-world applications to master the modern software lifecycle—focusing on Python, Containerization, and AI integration.

## 📂 Featured Project: The Gist
**Status:** *In Development*

In an age of information overload, **The Gist** is a "digital declutter" assistant designed to cut through the noise. It processes large blocks of text and returns exactly what you need to know.

### Core Features
* **The Bottom Line:** A one-sentence summary of the input text.
* **Action Items:** Automatically extracts tasks and "to-dos."
* **Urgency Score:** Analyzes the tone to determine priority.

### Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Logic:** NLP / Text Processing (Planned integration with LLMs)


## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
This MVP is built on a lightweight, deployable stack:

* **Streamlit (Frontend):** Chosen for its ability to rapidly turn data scripts into shareable web apps without needing a separate React/Vue frontend.
* **TextBlob (NLP Engine):** Used for the initial backend logic to handle part-of-speech tagging and sentiment analysis.
    * *Why TextBlob?* It provides a simple API for common NLP tasks, making it perfect for the MVP phase before integrating heavier LLMs (like OpenAI/Llama).
* **Python 3.x:** The core logic handles the scoring algorithms for "Urgency" and extracts actionable keywords.

## 🗺️ The Roadmap
I am building this repository "in public" to demonstrate competency in the following areas:

- [x] **Python Application Development** (Building "The Gist")
- [ ] **Containerization:** Dockerizing the application for consistent environments.
- [ ] **CI/CD:** Setting up pipelines (GitHub Actions) for automated testing.
- [ ] **Cloud Deployment:** Hosting the application on a cloud provider (AWS/GCP).
- [ ] **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Managing resources with Terraform/Ansible.
